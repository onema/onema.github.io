    <h2>Connecting an RDS database to your OpsWorks instance</h2>
    <p>
        According to Amazon <blockquote cite="http://symfony.com/doc/master/book/index.html">
        &ldquo;Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, 
        operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and 
        resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing 
        you up to focus on your applications and business&rdquo;.</blockquote>

        Unfortunately there is not an "out of the box" feature in OpsWorks. Thankfully, 
        getting an RDS connected is rather simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        First go to the RDS Dashboard and select "Security Groups" and "Create DB Security Group". 
        For the name use "opsworks" so we can identify it later and a description. Create the group.
        Select the group you just created to access the Security Group Details. Once you are here
        choose EC2 Security Group as the Connection Type. You will be presented with a list of EC2 Security Groups. 
        If you have used all the default values, you should select the "aws-opsworks-php-server" 
        (or the name of the security group your opsworks instances use) and add it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Now if you have an existing DB, select it from the list of instances and modify it. 
        Select the correct security group and check the box apply immediately. Please not you can select
        multiple security groups, and if you select just one, whatever security group you had before
        will be removed and instances currently using this database will no longer have access to it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you don't have an existing DB Launch a new DB instance and follow the Wizard. 
        When you get to the section
