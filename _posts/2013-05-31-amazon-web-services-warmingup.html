summary: AWS has a great ammount of services that are targeted to make operations simpler, scale faster and enable you to "survive your won success". But not all is as easy as they make it look like. Here I will try to describe what have been the challenges that our organization has had transitioning from a simple PaaS to AWS

<h2>Amazon Web Services: Warmingup</h2>
<p>Last year I had the opportunity to start using cloud computing with Rackspace Cloud. 
    It was really simple to create an account, and get started. Creating new load 
    balancers, adding servers and accessing the VMs was a breeze, even using their 
    API to fire up new instances was very simple.
</p>

<p>Mid-way through my project, I was part of the beta program for Cloud Databases. 
    The performance was surprisingly good and the fact that I didn't need to manage the DB 
    infrastructure was well worth the $80+ a month once it came out of beta.
</p>

<p>Customer service is free, and they are available 24/7... All in all I was quite happy with them.</p>

<p>But just like any other service, it wasn't perfect, I still had to provision, 
    secure and update my VMs and ended up seting up Capistrano as the deployment 
    system my code as they to my knowledge Rackspace donesn't offer an integrated 
    deployment system. As a developer I had an idea of how to setup 
    systems, but it was not my forte and getting to the point where I had a production 
    ready machine took some time.
</p>

<h3>Using a Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
<p>Later last year I changed jobs and started working with a San Diego star up. 
    They appointed me as the senior software engineer (this meant I has the project 
    manager, dev-ops guy, security expert, lead developer, conflict mediator... soon I was in operations hell), 
    and they needed our team to build from scratch a couple projects.
</p>

<p> As a startup getting up and running fast is a must. Instead of having to deal 
    with operations and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), I decided to start using 
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS). It was the right choice at the time because 
    it allowed us to get our first product site up and running in a matter of minutes.
</p>

<h3>Dirty Little Secrets</h3>
<p>The PaaS was a good temporary solution, but soon we were having performance 
    issues, and more down time than we thought it was acceptable. My boss insisted 
    that we should move to a more reliable service. We started looking 
    into AWS as it is what all the "cool kids" are using, plus Elastic Beanstalk 
    seemed to be almost exactly like a PaaS with the added benefit of auto-scaling. 
    The company sent me the first AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
</p>

</div>

<p>The conference was good, every single session aimed to display the strengths 
    of each of the services, or how small and large companies are using AWS to 
    power their technology. By the time I came back to San Diego I had a great 
    amount of head knowledge on how things worked, and knew exactly what products 
    I wanted to start using right away. 
</p>
<p>
    One thing I didn't hear at Re:Invent was the short comings, learning 
    curve, or possible difficulties I could run into to when trying to
    transfer our systems over. One thing is to know the concepts behind cloud computing
    and a very different was to get things up and running. Systems administration 
    is not my main job or passion and my goal is to spend as little time as possible doing operations 
    and more time coding... but while I got started with AWS this was not the case.
</p>

<h3>AWS and Elastic Beanstalk: "THE" learning curve</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned before, Elastic Beanstalk seem like the proper solution for 
    our needs, and granted it is a good service, but doing simple stuff like using git submodules,
    setting up a cron jobs, creating custom environment variables, installing SSL 
    certificates in the instance, or running worker queues without a single point of 
    failure (which is something you need to strive for when 
    setting infrastructure on the cloud) was a challenge. 
    Some of these things are not difficult in practice, but it was particularly 
    hard because the documentation is difficult to navigate, it is not always 
    clear if you don't read it <strong>ALL</strong> or it doesn't cover 
    common use cases. Finally <strong>the AWS forums and web search SUCK!</strong> 
    Don't expect to find anything quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you end up paying the $100 a month for support, you will spend a lot 
    of time going back and forth with them trying to get specific use cases to work.
</p>

<h3>Things that actually Rock about AWS</h3>
<p>
    Without a doubt the AWS APIs are very design, and the command line tools that use these APIs
    are easy to install and use (if you are comfortable using the *NIX terminal).
</p>
<p>
    AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is remarkable, and creating new users
    for developers and granting them specific access is not difficult. There 
    will be some special rules you may need some help with, but I've never had a too 
    much trouble setting up special permission such as allowing access to certain S3 
    buckets or allowing users to create new DNS records but never be able to delete them, 
    and pretty much any type of permission for every single service can be setup 
    through the IAM. Groups can be created and specific rules can be applied to them, 
    in this way adding or removing user permissions fast and simple. 
</p>
<p>
    Elastic Beanstalk is a one place stop to setup a complex cloud infrastructure: 
    Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Auto Scaling, vertical and horizontal scale, 
    Relational Databases, Monitoring, and editing some "Container Options" 
    like setting the document root of the application, 
    enabling Output compression, max execution time and environment variables 
    with generic names. Additional options like running migrations or installing/running 
    a dependency manager can be setup by using configuration files 
    that live in the .ebextensions directory.
    Finally one of the best features is that you can 
    deploy code as simple as:
    <pre><code>$ git aws.push</code></pre>
    This last step requires the eb command line tools.
    If your application is rather simple, and it needs to scale quickly, 
    you are up for a treat! 
</p>

<h3>OpsWorks</h3>
<p>
    Earlier this year AWS released a new service called OpsWorks, I was really 
    excited about using it because you could use custom chef cookbooks to provision 
    new instances. It is basically a managed chef service. Unfortunately as a ruby/chef 
    noob I found the documentation scarce, support didn't have enough knowledge on 
    the new service, and it was quite frustrating to get an application up and running. 
    To make things worst OpsWorks runs on an old version of Chef, this is quite 
    an inconvenience if you try to use community cookbooks because some 
    functionality may not be supported. But as I started to get comfortable with Chef, 
    I wrote my own recipes, granted basic, but they do what I need them to in order to 
    deploy different applications. Deployments are super easy and can be performed 
    directly from any branch in your hosted repository, reverting to a previous version is also quite simple. 
    You can host multiple applications in one or multiple machines, and setting 
    up systems running in different availability zones or regions is straight forward. 
</p>
<p>
    OpsWorks also comes with a large number of OS packages and recipes that can 
    be used to provision your instances without having to write any code. 
</p>
<h3>New Features and bug fixes</h3>
<p>
    On a weekly basis I receive one or more emails from AWS introducing new services, 
    features, or simple bug fixes. They are continually working on their products 
    making them better and easier to use. 
</p>

<p>
    It has been 6 months since I first started playing with AWS products, the 
    road has been a rocky experience specially juggling between operations and my other job 
    responsibilities. But it gets easier for me as I learn more, I spend 
    less time going through logs of failed deployments and I'm spending more time 
    coding, All our deployments and server provisioning is automated, we have 
    contributed a couple github repos that address some basic use cases such as setting
    environment variables, installing custom software, granting access control 
    amongst other things. 
</p>
    
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Today I actually enjoy working with AWS as setting up servers is much easier than it was at first. 
    We have production servers running on Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, and aquired through the market place. 
    In addition to these we are using Simple WorkFlow, Simple 
    Email Service, RDS, S3, Cloud Front, and Route53. We will continue to move the rest of our 
    applications over the next few months until we are running 100% on AWS.
</p>
    
<p>
    If you are a person with limited experience in system administration or have 
    a background using shared hosing or a PaaS, you may find the transition to AWS a bit rough. 
    But I will not discourage you from trying it out; experiment with some of the features, 
    look up for community contributed tutorials or code that will enable you to 
    get up and running faster, learn and understand the infrastructure, it will 
    empower you as a developer.
</p>
<p>
    Finally and as much as I hate to say it: read the documentation.
    As tedious as it may be, you are better off reading it all, rather than trying 
    to find your answer in the middle of the document. It will give 
    you a good insight of whether or not a particular service is what you need 
    and how it works.

    I started a series of tutorials on AWS describing how to accomplish basic 
    setups for your servers and applications. The first post in the series is:
    how to set up <a href="/blog/elastic-beanstal-custom-environment-variables/">custon environment variables</a> 
    in Elastic Beanstalk.
