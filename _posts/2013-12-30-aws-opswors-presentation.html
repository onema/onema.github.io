    <h2>Automated Provisioning and Application Deployments Presentation - January 8 2014</h2>
    <p>
       OpsWorks is almost one year old and I'm proud to say that I have used it since day one!
       Before OpsWorks I understood the importance of automating processes such as launching new instances,
       deploying code and auto-scaling. I used a few different PaaS, including PagodaBox, AppFog,
       and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, but none of these quite cut it.

        While AWS OpsWorks is not perfect by any means, it does enable developers to quickly solve some of the most
        common issues of managing the application life cycle.
