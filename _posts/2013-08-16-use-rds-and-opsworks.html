summary: OpsWorks offers a database layer, but it lacks some of the nice "managed" features RDS offers. Connecting an OpsWorks instance to an RDS DB is not to hard. Check it out.

    <h2>Connecting an RDS database to your OpsWorks instance</h2>
    <p>
        According to Amazon <blockquote cite="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">
        &ldquo;Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, 
        operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and 
        resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing 
        you up to focus on your applications and business&rdquo;.</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately at this time there is not an "out of the box" feature in OpsWorks. Thankfully, 
        getting an RDS connected is rather simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        First go to the RDS Dashboard and select "Security Groups" and "Create DB Security Group". 
    </p>

    <img src="/img/posts/rds-02.png" width="280" />
    
    <p>
        For the name use "opsworks" so we can identify it later and a description. Create the group.
    </p>
    
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-03.png" width="350" />
    
    <p>
        Select the group you just created to access the "Security Group Details". 
        Choose EC2 Security Group as the Connection Type. You will be presented with a list of EC2 Security Groups. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-04.png" width="300" />
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-05.png" width="600" />
    <p>
        You can select the "aws-opsworks-php-server" to give access to all your php applications 
        (or the name of the security group your opsworks instances uses) and add it. You can also 
        use an IP address or a range of addresses. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-06.png" width="300" />
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-07.png" width="600" />
    
    <p>
        Now if you have an existing DB, select it from the list of instances and modify it. 
        Select the correct security group and check the box apply immediately. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-08.png" width="400" />
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-09.png" width="500" />
    
    <p>
        Please note that you can select multiple security groups, and if you select just one, whatever security group you had before
        will be removed and instances currently using this database will no longer have access to it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you don't have an existing DB Launch a new DB instance and follow the Wizard. 
        When you get to the section "Additional Configuration" select the opsworks security group you created above. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-10.png" width="400" />
    <img src="/img/posts/rds-11.png" width="500" />
    <p>
        At this point all you need to do is setup your application to connect with the DB. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Conclusion: </strong>While RDS is not part of the OpsWors stack (yet), setting it up and getting access to it
        is just as simple as adding a new RDS security group and allowing OpsWorks instances access to it.
        For more information on how to do this using Chef see the AWS Documentation section 
        <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/customizing-rds.html">"To connect the PHP App server to an RDS database"</a>.

        to setup a different database for each application in the same stack. 
        The documentation on how to use this recipe is <a href="https://github.com/onema/opsworks-chef-cookbooks#fuelrdsconfig">here</a>.
